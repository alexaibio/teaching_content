Plan
- fpga is programmed with HDL language which model hardware directly by creating combinatorial or sequential logic
- the mapping from HDL to hardware curculty usually done by synthesiser (?) and to insure you get what you need one need to adhere to a certain HDL pattern to get exactly that hardware which was in your mind
- here we show System Verilog patterns and correspondent synthesised hardware for a number of commonly used elements
