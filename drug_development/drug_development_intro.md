# Modern Drug Development Process

The drug discovery process—finding new medications to help cure diseases—was originally driven either by chance or by the efforts of a single individual who truly believed in their mission and dedicated a significant part of their life to finding a new drug. The discovery of novel drugs was rare, and these drugs often suffered from unexpected side effects or questionable effectiveness.

Two major advancements changed the landscape. First, modern clinical trials, particularly double-blind and placebo-controlled studies, were developed to rigorously prove effectiveness and measure side effects. Second, high-throughput screening (HTS) transformed the process of discovering new chemicals from a random endeavor into a systematic one.

Today, there are two broad categories of drugs:
- Small molecules (commonly referred to as drugs), which are synthesized by pharmaceutical companies.
- Large molecules or biologics, which are typically proteins or other biological macromolecules. These are not synthesized chemically but are produced by living cells—such as bacterial, yeast, or mammalian cells—by biotechnology companies.

The development of a market-ready drug usually takes up to 10 years and can cost up to a billion dollars.

Recently, significant efforts have been made by many companies to incorporate Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques into the drug discovery process, with the goal of making it faster and more cost-effective.

It is also important to distinguish between the discovery of novel drugs and drug repurposing. The latter is usually much less expensive because the drug is simply repurposed for a new indication or dosage or packaging, allowing the company to skip the preclinical development stage and the Clinical Phase I safety stage altogether.


Modern Drug Development Cycle consists of three major stages
- Drug Discovery
- Preclinical development
- Clinical development


## Drug discovery stage
Drug is never exists in isolation, so finding a drug essentially means finding a tripple disease-target-drug.

On a drug dicovery stage a drug discovery team must come up with several candidate triples **disease-target-drug** which then shall be hanged over to pre-clinical team for much more expensive developmnt.

### Disease
For a drug discovery company choosing disease is usually a starting point. The company first decide to find a drug for lung cancer for example and then go next to target discovery and drug itself.

For a drug-repurposing company it might be other way round. Since they are trying to re-purpose the existing drug they might start from a drug then go to finding a novel target affected by this drug and then proceed to another disease, thatis their business.

### Target
After pinpointing a disease a target must be selected. Target is usually a protein or a gene, whcibmight be targeted.
